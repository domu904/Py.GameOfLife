# Game of Life in Python

This application simulation of Game of life bases on John Horton Conway.

It is is a cellular automaton and a zero-player game. The evolution is determined by its initial state, requiring no further input. One interacts with the Game of Life by creating an initial configuration and observing how it evolves.
