# Game of Life in Python

This application simulation of [Game of life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life) based on [John Horton Conway](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Horton_Conway).

It is is a cellular automaton and a zero-player game. The evolution is determined by its initial state, requiring no further input. One interacts with the Game of Life by creating an initial configuration and observing how it evolves.

**The rule for Game of Life is as follow:**

1. Any live cell with fewer than 2 live neighbour dies
2. Any live cell with 2 or 3 live neighbour lives on to the next generation
3. Any live cell with more than 3 live neighbour dies
4. Any dead cell with exactly 3 live neighbour becomes a live cell
