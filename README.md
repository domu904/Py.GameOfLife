# Game of Life in Python

This application simulation of [Game of life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life) based on [John Horton Conway](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Horton_Conway).

It is is a cellular automaton and a zero-player game. The evolution is determined by its initial state, requiring no further input. One interacts with the Game of Life by creating an initial configuration and observing how it evolves.

**The rule for Game of Life is as follow:**

1. Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, as if by underpopulation.
2. Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation.
3. Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by overpopulation.
4. Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.
